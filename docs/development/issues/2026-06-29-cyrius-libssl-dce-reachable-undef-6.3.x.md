# 2026-06-29 — cyrius 6.3.x linker drops sigil's `ct`/`thread_local` symbols under `-D CYRIUS_TLS_LIBSSL`

**Status:** open (cyrius-side).
**Severity:** low — affects only the **deprecated** libssl backend build, which
retires at sandhi 2.0. The native (no-flag) default — the shipping path — is
unaffected. Worked around sandhi-side by making the libssl CI step non-gating
(`continue-on-error`); no source change.
**Repo:** cyrius (toolchain). **Surfaced by:** sandhi 1.7.0's pin bump
`6.2.37 → 6.3.5`.

## Symptom

`CYRIUS_DCE=1 cyrius build -D CYRIUS_TLS_LIBSSL programs/smoke.cyr build/sandhi-smoke-libssl`
fails on cyrius 6.3.5:

```
warning: undefined function 'thread_local_init' (call site may be unreachable)
warning: undefined function 'thread_local_set'  (call site may be unreachable)
warning: undefined function 'thread_local_get'  (call site may be unreachable)
warning: undefined function 'ct_select'         (call site may be unreachable)
error: refusing to emit binary with 4 reachable undefined function(s) (pass --allow-undef to downgrade)
```

The **native** no-flag build of the same program links cleanly (only the
always-tolerated `sys_chdir` / `random_bytes` remain, both genuinely unreachable).

## Root cause (cyrius-side)

Two interacting toolchain facts:

1. **6.3.x promoted reachable-undefined from a NOP'd warning to a hard error.**
   (Same change that required `tests/alloc.tcyr` to complete its include list at
   sandhi 1.7.0 — there it was a genuine missing include; here it is not.)
2. **The symbols are NOT missing.** `thread_local_init/set/get` are defined in
   `lib/thread_local.cyr`, `ct_select` (+ `ct_eq_bytes`, `ct_eq_bytes_lens`) in
   `lib/ct.cyr`, `shake256` / `_keccak_f1600` in `lib/keccak.cyr` — all declared
   in sandhi's `cyrius.cyml [deps] stdlib`. Under **native** TLS the full sigil
   crypto path is reachable and cyrius force-links these callees. Under
   `-D CYRIUS_TLS_LIBSSL` the native crypto path is `#ifdef`'d out, leaving these
   4 functions reachable through sigil's SPKI-digest path (`sha256`, used by
   `src/tls_policy/apply.cyr`'s pin) **but not pulled into the link set** — so the
   stricter 6.3.x linker refuses to emit.

i.e. cyrius's DCE/on-demand-link reachability marks the call sites reachable but
fails to include the corresponding `ct`/`thread_local` definitions, specifically
in the libssl build configuration. Native masks it by force-linking the same
definitions through the native crypto path.

## Why this is not a sandhi or sigil defect

- sigil's source is correct; the symbols exist in the vendored stdlib.
- sandhi composes the stdlib `tls`/sigil contract and never opens its own crypto
  path (No-FFI). It already declares `ct`/`keccak`/`thread_local` as deps
  precisely to keep `sha256`'s callees linked (the 1.4.3 fix for the same class of
  link-drop) — that declaration is present and works for native.
- The libssl backend is deprecated and retires at sandhi 2.0; native is
  functionally complete.

## Requested cyrius-side fix (either)

1. **Fix the DCE/link reachability under the libssl config** so on-demand-linked
   `ct`/`thread_local` definitions are included when their call sites are reachable
   (parity with the native build), **or**
2. **Plumb `--allow-undef` through `cyrius build`** (it is accepted by the
   underlying linker — the error message suggests it — but `cyrius build` rejects
   it as `unknown flag`, and there is no env-var equivalent), so a deprecated build
   can downgrade reachable-undefined to a warning as it did pre-6.3.x.

Fix (1) is the cleaner outcome; (2) is an acceptable escape hatch given the
backend's pending retirement.

## sandhi-side disposition

- CI: the libssl smoke step is now `continue-on-error: true`
  (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — kept for signal, no longer gating.
- Roadmap: a watch tracks dropping the step entirely at the 2.0 libssl retirement
  (see `roadmap.md` Batch A). No sandhi source change; no FFI workaround.

## Log

- **2026-07-11 (sandhi 1.8.1 / cyrius `6.4.49`) — re-verified; still open, symptom
  shifted.** The libssl smoke build (both `CYRIUS_DCE=1` *and* plain) still hard-
  fails, but the reachable-undef set **changed**: the four `thread_local_init/set/
  get` + `ct_select` symbols now link (toolchain progress since 6.3.5), and the
  single remaining reachable-undef is **`sha256`** (with `base64_encode` as an
  unreachable-warning companion). Same upstream class — sigil's `sha256`
  (the SPKI-pin digest in `apply.cyr`) is reachable under libssl but its
  definition isn't pulled into the link set, because the native crypto path that
  force-links it is `#ifdef`'d out under `-D CYRIUS_TLS_LIBSSL`. The **native
  no-flag build links clean** (the shipping path). Note: 1.8.0 streamlined the
  explicit `[deps]` (dropped `bayan`/`ct`/`keccak`/`thread_local` — cyrius 6.4.x
  resolves them transitively for native); this does not change the disposition —
  the libssl path was already failing on 6.3.5, is non-gating (`continue-on-error`),
  and retires at sandhi 2.0. No sandhi source change; no FFI workaround.
