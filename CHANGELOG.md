## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-24

### Added
- **server**: lift-and-shift of `lib/http_server.cyr` into `src/server/mod.cyr`. Status codes, request parsing (`http_get_method` / `http_get_path` / `http_find_header` / `http_content_length`), path + query helpers (`http_path_only` / `http_url_decode` / `http_get_param` / `http_path_segment`), response builders (`http_send_status` / `http_send_response` / `http_send_204`), chunked / SSE (`http_send_chunked_start` / `http_send_chunk` / `http_send_chunked_end`), request reader (`http_recv_request`), and accept-loop (`http_server_run`) — all moved verbatim from the interim stdlib file. No behavior change.
- **tests**: pure-helper unit tests exercising the migrated server symbols (url decoding, path segmentation, query param extraction, request parsing) — 28 assertions green.
- **smoke**: `programs/smoke.cyr` now exercises `http_url_decode` so the linker actually pulls the migrated code in.

### Changed
- **cyrius.cyml**: `http_server` removed from `[deps.stdlib]`; sandhi is now self-sufficient for the HTTP server surface. Stdlib-side stays unchanged through the 5.6.x window and is resolved in one event at Cyrius v5.7.0 per [ADR 0002](docs/adr/0002-clean-break-fold-at-cyrius-v5-7-0.md) — `lib/http_server.cyr` is deleted and `lib/sandhi.cyr` is added as a clean-break fold. 5.6.YY releases carry a deprecation warning on include.

### Decisions
- **[ADR 0002](docs/adr/0002-clean-break-fold-at-cyrius-v5-7-0.md) — Clean-break fold at Cyrius v5.7.0.** Supersedes the alias-window migration plan from ADR 0001 / roadmap M1 / M6. One event at v5.7.0 instead of a two-copy window; 5.6.YY deprecation warning as the notice period.
